FLAG: geek{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cEDf1591}
COMMAND USED: grep -o "geek{[^}]*}" file
EXPLANATION: grep is a command used to scan files to find matching text.
             The -o flag is used to print only the matching part and not the whole text.
	     "geek{...}" is the text we are looking for. [^}] means: match any character except }.
	     * means repeat the previous task more times. So [^}]* means: match any number of characters until we encounter a }.
