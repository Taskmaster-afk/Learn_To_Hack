I used grep -o "{[^}]*}" file to search the file for text enclosed in curly braces.
The -o option makes grep output only the matching portion instead of the entire line.
The regular expression matches an opening {, any characters except }, and the closing }.
This allows the hidden flag to be extracted even from a single very long line of text.
